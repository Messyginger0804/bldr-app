# Starfleet Task Manager

## Overview

Starfleet Task Manager is a real-time task collaboration app inspired by Star Trek. The app allows users to manage tasks in a shared environment with specific roles:

- **Commanding Officers (Managers):** Can add tasks, delete tasks, and add bullet points to tasks.
- **Starfleet Officers (Employees):** Can add bullet points to tasks but cannot delete tasks.

This application uses **React** for the frontend, **Socket.IO** for real-time communication, and a simple in-memory backend server for handling tasks and user roles.

## Features

1. **User Roles:**
   - Commanding Officers (Managers): Add, delete, and update tasks.
   - Starfleet Officers (Employees): Update tasks by adding bullet points.
2. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - All tasks and updates are synced across connected clients using Socket.IO.
3. **Task Management:**
   - Add tasks.
   - Add bullet points to tasks.
   - Delete tasks (Manager-only).
4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Tasks are displayed in a grid layout with responsive columns for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
5. **Star Trek Theme:**
   - Styled with Tailwind CSS to reflect a futuristic Star Trek aesthetic.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Socket.IO-Client
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
